            Data class that contains meta-data relating to a specific 
            component.
            A component is a logical group of properties for example, all
            properties relating to the internet service providers (Isp) or
            all properties relating to the autonomous system (Asns).
            This variation is used for meta-data that is generated by the
            c# code rather than the native C/C++ code.
            For example, this is used to add placeholder component meta-data 
            for the 'metrics' properties because they don't have any associated
            meta-data in the data file.
